After analyzing the data from the Dealer schedules, player wins and losses during the days of the losses which were: March 10, 12, and 15. I've found the rogue player and dealer responsible for the losses.
First, I analyzed the player wins and losses, and isolated all of the losses that occured on March 10, 12, and 15. I found that the losses ocurred during 5am, 8am, 2pm, 8pm, and 11pm. Upon further review, I found that a specific player was there in each one of those times - Mylie Schmidt. 
Now that I found the rogue player, my next task was to find the rogue dealer. So next, I reviewed the Dealer schedules. Using my findings from before, I isolated the dealers working during 5am, 8am, 2pm, 8pm and 11pm on March 10, 12, and 15. After analyzing the data, I found that Billy Jones worked each time the losses occured, so I believe he is the rogue dealer.
